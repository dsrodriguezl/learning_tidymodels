I created this repository to learn and practice the Tidymodels workflow/approach
modeling and machine learning in R.

I structure the data manipulations and analyses within the project with
reproducible science principle in mind, including the usage of "master" script 
([Analysis.R](Analysis.R)`)) to execute the whole collection of procedures in a reproducible manner.
