README
================

I created this repository to learn and practice the Tidymodels
workflow/approach modeling and machine learning in R.

I structure the data manipulations and analyses within the project with
reproducible science principle in mind, including the usage of “master”
script
([Analysis.R](Z:/Documentos/Estudio/learning_tidymodels/Analysis.R)) to
execute the whole collection of procedures in a reproducible manner.
